ISSUE 2: DATABASE CONNECTION POOL EXHAUSTION

SYMPTOMS:
The application was experiencing database-related performance issues that contributed to the overall hang episodes. Database operations would become slow or timeout, causing requests to queue up and block the thread pool. During hang periods, database queries would take significantly longer than normal, and some operations would fail with connection timeout errors. The database server itself showed low CPU utilization (under 5%), indicating that the issue was not with database performance but with connection management and availability.

ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS:
Database connection pool exhaustion occurs when all available database connections in the connection pool are in use, forcing new database operations to wait for a connection to become available. This creates a cascading effect where database operations block threads, which in turn blocks the thread pool, leading to application hangs. The issue was compounded by the application's multi-tenant architecture, where each tenant operation might require database connections, and the ABP framework's Unit of Work pattern, which could hold connections longer than necessary.

SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED:
1. Connection Pool Optimization: Enhanced the connection string in appsettings.json with optimized pool settings:
   - Increased Min Pool Size to 20 connections to ensure adequate baseline availability
   - Set Max Pool Size to 200 connections to handle peak load scenarios
   - Extended Command Timeout to 60 seconds for complex operations
   - Added Application Name for better monitoring and debugging

2. Entity Framework Configuration: Added comprehensive Entity Framework settings in appsettings.json:
   - CommandTimeout: 60 seconds for database operations
   - EnableRetryOnFailure: true to handle transient database failures
   - MaxRetryCount: 3 attempts for failed operations

3. Connection Resilience: Implemented retry logic and connection resilience patterns to handle transient database failures and connection issues.

4. Monitoring Integration: Enhanced Application Insights monitoring to track database connection pool metrics and alert on connection pool exhaustion.

TECHNICAL DETAILS:
Connection String Optimizations:
- Min Pool Size: 20 (ensures minimum connection availability)
- Max Pool Size: 200 (handles peak load scenarios)
- Command Timeout: 60 seconds (accommodates complex queries)
- Connection Timeout: 30 seconds (reasonable connection establishment time)
- Application Name: "DispatcherWeb" (enables connection tracking)
- MultipleActiveResultSets: true (supports concurrent operations)
- TrustServerCertificate: true (development environment)
- Encrypt: false (development environment)

Entity Framework Configuration:
- CommandTimeout: 60 seconds
- EnableRetryOnFailure: true
- MaxRetryCount: 3
- Connection Resiliency: Automatic retry on transient failures

IMPACT AND BENEFITS:
1. Improved Connection Availability: Higher minimum pool size ensures connections are readily available
2. Better Peak Load Handling: Increased maximum pool size accommodates traffic spikes
3. Enhanced Reliability: Retry logic handles transient database failures gracefully
4. Reduced Timeouts: Extended command timeout prevents premature operation cancellation
5. Better Monitoring: Application name enables connection tracking and debugging
6. Improved Performance: Optimized connection management reduces wait times for database operations

MONITORING METRICS:
- Database_ConnectionPool_Available: Number of available connections
- Database_ConnectionPool_InUse: Number of connections currently in use
- Database_ConnectionPool_Utilization: Percentage of connections in use
- Database_CommandTimeout_Count: Number of command timeouts
- Database_Retry_Count: Number of retry attempts
- Database_Connection_Errors: Number of connection errors

ALERT CONDITIONS:
- Warning: Connection pool utilization > 80%
- Critical: Connection pool utilization > 90%
- Error: Command timeout frequency > threshold
- Error: Connection error frequency > threshold

PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENTS:
1. Reduced Database Wait Times: Optimized connection pool reduces time spent waiting for database connections
2. Better Concurrent Operation Support: Higher connection limits support more simultaneous database operations
3. Improved Error Handling: Retry logic prevents failures due to transient database issues
4. Enhanced Scalability: Connection pool optimization supports higher application load
5. Reduced Thread Blocking: Faster database access reduces thread pool pressure

CONFIGURATION CHANGES:
appsettings.json modifications:
```json
"ConnectionStrings": {
  "Default": "Server=...;Database=DispatcherWebDb;...;Min Pool Size=20;Max Pool Size=200;Command Timeout=60;Application Name=DispatcherWeb"
},
"EntityFramework": {
  "CommandTimeout": 60,
  "EnableRetryOnFailure": true,
  "MaxRetryCount": 3
}
```

This solution addresses database connection pool exhaustion by ensuring adequate connection availability, implementing resilience patterns, and providing comprehensive monitoring to detect and prevent connection-related performance issues before they impact application responsiveness.
