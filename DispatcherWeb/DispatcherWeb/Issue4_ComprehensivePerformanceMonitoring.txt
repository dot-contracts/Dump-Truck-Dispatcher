ISSUE 4: COMPREHENSIVE PERFORMANCE MONITORING IMPLEMENTATION

SYMPTOMS:
The application lacked comprehensive performance monitoring capabilities, making it difficult to identify the root causes of periodic hangs and performance degradation. When performance issues occurred, there was limited visibility into what was happening at the request level, thread pool state, and application health. The existing monitoring was insufficient to provide real-time alerts and detailed analysis of performance bottlenecks, making it challenging to proactively address issues before they impacted users.

ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS:
The application was missing detailed performance monitoring infrastructure that could provide real-time visibility into application health, request performance, and resource utilization. Without comprehensive monitoring, performance issues could only be detected after they had already impacted users, and root cause analysis was difficult due to lack of detailed metrics and context. The existing Application Insights integration was basic and didn't provide the granular data needed to identify thread pool starvation, database connection issues, and request-level performance problems.

SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED:
1. EnhancedPerformanceMonitoringMiddleware: Created a comprehensive middleware that captures detailed metrics for every HTTP request, including:
   - Request duration and performance metrics
   - Thread pool state at the start and end of each request
   - Thread utilization patterns and context
   - Request path, method, and status code tracking
   - Slow request detection and alerting

2. ThreadPoolMonitoringService: Implemented a dedicated background service that continuously monitors thread pool health every 30 seconds, providing:
   - Real-time thread pool utilization metrics
   - Proactive alerts for high utilization scenarios
   - Detailed logging for debugging thread pool issues
   - Historical trend analysis capabilities

3. Application Insights Integration: Enhanced the Application Insights integration with:
   - Custom metrics for performance monitoring
   - Comprehensive alerting rules for critical thresholds
   - Detailed event tracking for performance analysis
   - Exception tracking with context

4. Configuration Management: Added configuration options to enable/disable monitoring features:
   - DisablePerformanceMonitoringMiddleware flag
   - DisableAppInsights flag
   - Conditional middleware registration

TECHNICAL DETAILS:
EnhancedPerformanceMonitoringMiddleware Implementation:
```csharp
public async Task InvokeAsync(HttpContext context)
{
    var stopwatch = Stopwatch.StartNew();
    var startThreadPoolState = GetThreadPoolState();
    
    try
    {
        await _next(context);
        var endThreadPoolState = GetThreadPoolState();
        TrackRequestMetrics(context, stopwatch.ElapsedMilliseconds, 
            Thread.CurrentThread.ManagedThreadId, startThreadPoolState, endThreadPoolState);
    }
    catch (Exception ex)
    {
        // Error tracking with context
        _telemetryClient.TrackException(ex);
        throw;
    }
}
```

ThreadPoolMonitoringService Implementation:
```csharp
protected override async Task ExecuteAsync(CancellationToken stoppingToken)
{
    while (!stoppingToken.IsCancellationRequested)
    {
        await MonitorThreadPoolHealthAsync();
        await Task.Delay(TimeSpan.FromSeconds(30), stoppingToken);
    }
}
```

IMPACT AND BENEFITS:
1. Real-time Visibility: Comprehensive monitoring provides immediate insight into application performance
2. Proactive Alerting: Early detection of performance issues before they impact users
3. Detailed Context: Thread pool state tracking provides context for performance analysis
4. Historical Analysis: Detailed metrics enable trend analysis and pattern identification
5. Improved Debugging: Enhanced logging and telemetry aid in root cause analysis
6. Better Resource Management: Monitoring helps optimize resource utilization

MONITORING METRICS:
Request-Level Metrics:
- Request_Duration: Time taken for each HTTP request
- Request_ThreadId: Thread ID handling the request
- Request_StartWorkerThreadUtilization: Thread pool utilization at request start
- Request_EndWorkerThreadUtilization: Thread pool utilization at request end
- Request_StartCompletionPortUtilization: Completion port utilization at request start
- Request_EndCompletionPortUtilization: Completion port utilization at request end

Thread Pool Metrics:
- ThreadPool_WorkerThreadUtilization: Percentage of worker threads in use
- ThreadPool_CompletionPortUtilization: Percentage of completion port threads in use
- ThreadPool_AvailableWorkerThreads: Number of available worker threads
- ThreadPool_AvailableCompletionPortThreads: Number of available completion port threads
- ThreadPool_MaxWorkerThreads: Maximum number of worker threads
- ThreadPool_MaxCompletionPortThreads: Maximum number of completion port threads

Performance Alerts:
- Slow Request Alert: Requests taking longer than 1000ms
- High Thread Pool Utilization: Utilization exceeding 80% (warning) or 90% (critical)
- Request Error Rate: Error rate exceeding thresholds
- Database Connection Pool: Connection pool utilization alerts

ALERT CONDITIONS:
- Warning: Thread pool utilization > 80% OR request duration > 1000ms
- Critical: Thread pool utilization > 90% OR request duration > 5000ms
- Error: Request error rate > threshold OR database connection errors
- Events: ThreadPool_HighUtilization_Alert, ThreadPool_Exhaustion_Alert, Request_Slow_Alert

CONFIGURATION OPTIONS:
appsettings.json configuration:
```json
"App": {
  "DisablePerformanceMonitoringMiddleware": false,
  "DisableAppInsights": false
}
```

Startup.cs Registration:
```csharp
// Thread pool configuration
ThreadPool.SetMinThreads(Environment.ProcessorCount * 2, Environment.ProcessorCount * 2);
ThreadPool.SetMaxThreads(Environment.ProcessorCount * 4, Environment.ProcessorCount * 4);

// Service registration
services.AddHostedService<ThreadPoolMonitoringService>();

// Middleware registration
app.UseMiddleware<EnhancedPerformanceMonitoringMiddleware>();
```
